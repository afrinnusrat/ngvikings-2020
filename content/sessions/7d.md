Are you done delivering that code? What is done? Are you confident it till stay up and running? Are you confident that the bug you fixed didn't break something else? Are you confident someone else could pick up your code and run with it? Writing code is the easy part, everything after it is the hard part. Following the 7 D's of development will help you deliver higher quality product and make you feel more confident about saying "it's done".
